```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


# Setup

```{r}
library(dplyr)
voice <- read.csv('voice.csv')
```

# EDA 
* 3168 observations

```{r}
sum(is.na(voice))
```

* No missing values

```{r}
summary(voice)
```

* Even split between male and female observations

```{r}
pairs(voice)
```


```{r}
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = melt(voice), mapping = aes(x = value)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 10) + facet_wrap(~variable, scales = 'free_x')
```

* Should log `kurt`
* Should log `skew`


In order to reduce multicollinearity while keeping info:
* Keep `meanfreq`, `mode`, and `sd`, but not `Q25`, `Q75`, `IQR`, `centroid`, and `median`
* Choose between `skew` and `kurt`
* Do not use `dfrange` due to correlation with `mindom` and `maxdom`
* `peakf` is not in the dataset, even though it's in the data dictionary on Kaggle
